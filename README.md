### Neuroscience

*Brain Stem:* Regulator between brain and spinal cord

*Cerebellum:* Helps in correcting mistakes made during learning some activity
like piano learning etc. and helps in motor movement, learn something new.

#### Cortex
1. Frontal Lobe - Plans your actions and control your movement, one part
controls leff foot, one part left hand etc.
2. Parietal Lobe - Senses touch information of outside world. Fingertips have
large area allocated to them.
3. Temporal Lobe - Auditory Information, hearing, memory formation
4. occipital lobe - Visual Information

#### Limbic system
1. It is below the cortex but above brain stem.

#### Hippocampus
1. Forming new memory, storage is elsewhere.

#### Amygdala
1. Fear and anxiety

#### Hypothalamus
1. 4 F's, fear, flight, feeding and fucking
2. Release Hormones

#### Brain Internal Structure
Interconnected web of mess, Individual cells, Cells other than neurons, 90%
cells (glia meaning glue), star-shaped cell to supply nutrients to neurons and
regulate.

#### Neurons
1. 100 billion neurons with 10000 connections each to other neurons called
synapses.
2. Dendrites receive info from neurons.
3. Soma is cell body of the Neuron, nucleus also there.
4. Axon hillock determine whether to pass info to other neuron or not, axon is
kind of wire using which info is getting sent. Terminal is endpoint.
5. Neuron is on or off not partial.
6. Neuron state is determined by the positive charge in cell body, if that
reaches the threshold at axon hillock, action potential, then more positive 
charge is taken in by opening other channels around axon hillock, which will 
reach to axon terminals, then vesicles can release neurotransmitters.

Vesicles and Neurotransmitters

Due to the positive charge in axon terminal, vesicles release the
neurotransmitters.

Once the presynaptic neuron is bound to the postsynaptic neuron receptor. It
can trigger 2 effects:
1. Opening of a channel to allow ions to flow in.
2. Genomic Effect: Neurotransmitter is released and might bind to the receptor,
influence transcription factor, production of more receptors, which make
synapse more responsive.
3. Single type of neurotransmitter can have different functions in different part
of the brain.

#### Types of Neurotransmitters:
1. Dopamine - related to reward system, can have many different functions
2. Epinephrine/adrenaline - fight or flight response
3. Norepinephrine - Similar to Epinephrine
4. Serotonin - regulation of sleep, appetite and mood
5. Acetylcholine
6. GABA - most inhibitory
7. Glutamate - most excitatory
8. Neuromuscular Junction - muscle work in same way it have receptors to
neurotransmitters

#### Neuromuscular Junction - muscle work in same way it have receptors to
neurotransmitters

#### Neuropharmacology: Changing the receptor intensity, using lsd mescaline etc.

#### Neuropathology
Changing dopamine to treat Parkinsons can results in other problems for
example schizophrenia, because dopamine change is global.

#### Types of Memory
1. Mechanism of memory and how are these contextually motivated?
2. Memory learning happens in synapse.
3. Neurons that fire together wire together.
